Code Explanation
This code loads, cleans, and visualizes banking transaction data from an Excel file. The key steps are as follows:

Code Breakdown
Importing Libraries:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Loading the Excel File:

python
Copy code
file_path = 'd:/bank.xlsx'
bank_data = pd.read_excel(file_path)
The Excel file is read into a DataFrame using pd.read_excel(). Replace 'd:/bank.xlsx' with the path to your data file.
Data Cleaning:

python
Copy code
bank_data_cleaned = bank_data.drop(columns=['CHQ.NO.', '.']).dropna(subset=['DATE', 'BALANCE AMT'])
bank_data_cleaned['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(bank_data_cleaned['DATE'])
bank_data_cleaned.set_index('DATE', inplace=True)
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Removes the columns 'CHQ.NO.' and '.', which are not needed for the analysis.
Handle Missing Data: Drops rows that have missing values in the 'DATE' and 'BALANCE AMT' columns.
Convert and Set Date Index: Converts the 'DATE' column to datetime format and sets it as the DataFrame index, preparing it for time-based resampling.
Resampling Monthly Data:

python
Copy code
monthly_data = bank_data_cleaned.resample('M').sum(numeric_only=True)
This resamples the data to calculate monthly totals for withdrawals and deposits. The resample('M') method groups data by month, and .sum() aggregates the amounts for each month.
Plotting Withdrawals and Deposits:

python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_data.index, monthly_data['WITHDRAWAL AMT'], label='Monthly Withdrawals', color='red', marker='o')
plt.plot(monthly_data.index, monthly_data['DEPOSIT AMT'], label='Monthly Deposits', color='green', marker='o')
plt.title("Monthly Withdrawals and Deposits Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Amount")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
Figure and Axes Setup: A figure with a specified size is created.
Plotting Monthly Withdrawals and Deposits:
The plt.plot() function plots the WITHDRAWAL AMT and DEPOSIT AMT columns on the y-axis against the date on the x-axis.
Different colors and labels help distinguish withdrawals (red) from deposits (green).
Titles and Labels: Adds a title and labels for the x and y axes.
Legend and Grid: The legend differentiates the lines, and a grid enhances readability.
Visualization: Monthly Withdrawals and Deposits Over Time
This line chart shows trends in withdrawals and deposits by month. Each point on the line represents the total withdrawal or deposit amount for a given month. The red line represents monthly withdrawals, while the green line represents monthly deposits.
This visualization makes it easy to spot trends, such as months with higher spending or savings, by observing the rise and fall in transaction volumes over time.
